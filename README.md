Task Manager Project
Overview
The Task Manager Project is a full-stack application that allows users to manage their tasks. It provides a RESTful API for backend functionality and a React-based frontend to interact with the API. Users can create, update, delete, and fetch tasks. The application is designed to be simple and efficient for managing tasks and can be extended for additional features.

Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

task-manager-backend: The backend API that handles task management and authentication.
task-manager-frontend: The frontend application built with React that allows users to interact with the backend.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Git for version control
Setup Instructions
Backend Setup (task-manager-backend)
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/VaibhavChaudhari22/Task-Manager.git
cd Task-Manager/task-manager-backend
2.Install Dependencies: In the task-manager-backend folder, run: npm install

3.Configuration: Set up the necessary environment variables (e.g., database URI, JWT secret). You can create a .env file in the root of the backend folder with the following variables: PORT=5000 DB_URI= JWT_SECRET=

4.Run the Server: To start the backend server, run: npm server.js

The backend will be available at http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup (task-manager-frontend)

Navigate to the Frontend Folder: cd task-manager-frontend
2.Install Dependencies: In the task-manager-frontend folder, run: npm install

3.Build the Application (optional, for production): If you are ready to deploy, build the application by running: npm run build

4.Run the Application: To start the frontend server in development mode, run: npm start

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints Task Management GET /tasks: Fetch all tasks. GET /tasks/:id: Fetch a single task by its ID. POST /tasks: Add a new task (requires authentication). PUT /tasks/:id: Update a task by its ID (requires authentication). DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by its ID (requires authentication). Authentication POST /auth/register: Register a new user. POST /auth/login: Login to the application and get a JWT token for authenticated routes. Error Handling The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate errors:

400 Bad Request: Invalid data or missing parameters. 404 Not Found: Resource not found (e.g., task not found). 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server error. Features Task CRUD operations: Create, read, update, and delete tasks. User authentication: Users can register, login, and manage their tasks securely. JWT Authentication: Routes that modify tasks are protected by JWT authentication. Error handling: Proper error messages and status codes are returned for all endpoints. Deployment The application is designed for easy deployment. You can deploy the backend on services like Heroku or Vercel and the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.

Deployment Steps (Frontend) Build the Frontend: Run npm run build to create the production build of your React app. Deploy the Build Folder: You can deploy the contents of the build/ folder to any hosting service like Netlify or Vercel. Deployment Steps (Backend) Deploy the Backend: Deploy the task-manager-backend folder to a platform like Heroku or Render. Make sure to set environment variables for the database URI and JWT secret.
